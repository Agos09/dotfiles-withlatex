My First Rice Setup:

![Picture of my setup](https://i.imgur.com/cBr9unV.png)

Running programs (gotop, pipes.sh, cava, ranger, neofetch)

This setup is for Arch Linux running KDE Plasma as your Desktop Environment and i3-gaps-rounded as your Window Manager.

Just some basic files for my rice config. This project currenly is empty, but soon I will be adding scripts and a lot of stuff - as soon as I find out how to do so.

I have imgur-screenshot as my screenshot tool, cmus as my music manager and feh as my wallpaper manager.
