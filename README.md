My First Rice Setup:

![Picture of my setup](https://i.redd.it/2mewpo1f1s541.png)

Running programs (gotop, cli-vis, nvim, neofetch)

This rice is on Arch linux with Plasma as my Desktop Environment, i3-gaps as the Window Manager and picom as the compositor.

This includes all the files for my setup - in the future I will be adding more to this repo.

I have imgur-screenshot as my screenshot tool, cmus as my music manager and feh as my wallpaper manager.
